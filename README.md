Your role is to handle the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the prototype, incorporating key features and ensuring accessibility.

## 🛸 **Technologies Used**

*JavaScript  
*HTML  
*CSS  

## 🏃‍♀️ **How to Run**

- Fork the Repository
- Work on a forked copy to avoid affecting the main repository.
- Use separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better code management.
- Thoroughly comment your code, documenting functions, classes, and complex sections.
- Check GitHub issues for tasks assigned and follow instructions for completion.
- Perform manual testing on features, ensuring responsiveness and addressing any identified issues.
- Code review will be conducted before the project is ready for production.

## 🕵️‍♀️ **Code Overview**

- JavaScript: Utilize Factory Method pattern for creating media elements (photos/videos).
- HTML: Create main page and individual photographer pages based on approved designs.
- CSS: Implement styles according to the designer's mockups.

 ## ✏️ **Development Notes**

- Refer to the detailed notes from the client meeting outlining features, technical requirements, and accessibility considerations.
- Use the provided examples of photos, videos, and JSON-formatted data to dynamically create photographer pages.
- Zoe, a senior developer, recommended implementing the Factory Method pattern for handling photos and videos, she shared a valuable technical tip: use the Factory Method pattern to distinguish between photos and videos when dealing with FishEye's media content. This will enhance the creation process for these elements.

## 💬 **Communication with Amanda  **

Amanda, the project manager, emphasized the importance of accessibility and requested a GitHub repository with completed code for review. Ensure that the prototype aligns with the approved designs and functions without errors in the console.

 ## 📊**Tasks Overview**

- Develop the main page with six visible photographer profiles, _prioritizing accessibility_.
- Create individual photographer pages with detailed information (name, location, description, tags, daily price) and robust _accessibility_ features.
- Implement the Factory Method pattern for handling photos and videos while considering _accessibility guidelines_.
